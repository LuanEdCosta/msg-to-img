## :fire: Motivation

This was my first project using Svelte. I always wanted to learn it.

I just loved the syntax :heart:. Everything is so simple and the final bundle is tiny. I'll probably use Svelte in my other personal projects for sure :+1:.

## :computer: Development

Clone the project, open a terminal window and run:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```
